Spaghetti Carbonara

Ingredients:

12 ounces (340 grams) spaghetti
2 large eggs
1 cup (about 100 grams) grated Pecorino Romano cheese
4 ounces (113 grams) pancetta or guanciale, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

Instructions:

1)Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti.

2)While the pasta is cooking, whisk the eggs in a bowl and mix in about 3/4 of the grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Season with a generous pinch of black pepper. Set aside.

3)In a large skillet over medium heat, add the diced pancetta or guanciale. Cook until it becomes crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. If there is excessive fat, you can drain some, but leave a little in the pan for flavor. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.

4)Remove the skillet from heat. Immediately, add the cooked and drained spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and garlic. Toss everything together to combine.

5)Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta. Use tongs to toss the pasta continuously, so the eggs don't scramble but instead create a creamy sauce that coats the spaghetti. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta cooking water to achieve your desired consistency.

6)Serve the spaghetti carbonara hot, garnished with the remaining grated Pecorino Romano cheese and a sprinkle of chopped fresh parsley.

Chicken Alfredo

Ingredients:

8 ounces (about 225 grams) fettuccine pasta
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
Salt and black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream
1/2 cup (120 ml) chicken broth
1 cup (about 100 grams) grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup (about 25 grams) grated Pecorino Romano cheese (optional)
2 tablespoons butter
Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

Instructions:

1)Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.

2)In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil. Once hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for about 6-8 minutes per side or until they are cooked through and no longer pink in the center. Remove the chicken from the skillet and let it rest for a few minutes. Then, slice it into thin strips.

3)In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.

4)Pour in the heavy cream and chicken broth. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 2 minutes.

5)Gradually whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese and, if using, the Pecorino Romano cheese until the sauce becomes smooth and creamy.

6)Return the sliced chicken to the skillet and stir to coat it with the sauce. Let it simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat the chicken through.

7)While the sauce is simmering, cook the fettuccine pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta.

8)Add the cooked fettuccine to the skillet with the chicken and sauce. Toss everything together to combine and coat the pasta evenly.

9)Stir in the butter until it melts and fully incorporates into the sauce.

10)Garnish the Chicken Alfredo with chopped fresh parsley and serve hot.
